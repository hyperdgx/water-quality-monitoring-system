`Project Name:` An IOT Based Water Quality Monitoring System

`Project Description:` Our project, the "An IOT Based Water Quality Monitoring System," aims to create a smart solution using the ESP32 microcontroller to check if the water we drink is safe. This will be a very initial approach to convert many non-smart objects into smart objects. Here, our objects can be considered as water tanks, water coolers, water filters, and other water resources and containers.

This project can be useful for both general purposes and agricultural activities. It prioritises testing and ensuring the functionality of irrigation systems. We want to make sure the water in different tanks, like those in your home or storage, meets quality standards. The project helps us keep an eye on water quality in real-time. Which help us to regularly clean water tankers or water storing sources and resources.
