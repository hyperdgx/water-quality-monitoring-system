                    Monitoring System,"</span> aims to create a smart solution using
                the ESP32 microcontroller to check if the water we drink is safe. This will be a very initial
                approach to convert many non-smart objects into smart objects. Here, our objects can be
                considered as water tanks, water coolers, water filters, and other water resources and
                containers.

                This project can be useful for both general purposes and agricultural activities. It prioritises
                testing and ensuring the functionality of irrigation systems. We want to make sure the water in
                different tanks, like those in your home or storage, meets quality standards. The project helps
                us keep an eye on water quality in real-time. Which help us to regularly clean water tankers or
                water storing sources and resources.

            <p class="imp"><span class="learntitle">Project Scope: </span>Our project focuses on building a system that checks
                water quality using tiny sensors. It's like
                having a guardian for your water, making sure it's safe to drink. We want to use this system in
                different types of water tanks because water is the first priority of any human or living
                organism. Therefore, if the water is clean and pure, our health issues are going to be
                dramatically decreased.
